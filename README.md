# OOP in Java

This repository demonstrates the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. It includes practical examples and detailed explanations of key OOP principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Key Concepts Covered:
- **Classes and Objects**: Learn how to define classes and create objects.
- **Encapsulation**: Understand how to protect object data by using access control.
- **Inheritance**: Explore how one class can inherit properties and methods from another.
- **Polymorphism**: See how methods can behave differently based on the object calling them.
- **Abstraction**: Learn how to abstract functionality using abstract classes and interfaces.

## Project Structure:
The repository is organized into Java files where each file contains practical examples illustrating OOP concepts. Each Java file includes comments explaining the logic and purpose of the code.

## Prerequisites
Before running the examples, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (version 8 or higher)
- A Java IDE or text editor (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, etc.)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muskankhan28/oops-java.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
